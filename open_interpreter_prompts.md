# Open interpeter prompts

* **First prompt** : Take a deep breath and solve my problem step by step. I got a .csv (/Users/arthursarazin/Desktop/panneaux.csv) file with location description, but very approximative. First, what I want you to do is to extract any name of street avenue. Data is in French so the streets name can be text after “rue”, ”boulevard” ou “avenue”


* **Second prompt :** Now, I got a .csv (/Users/arthursarazin/Desktop/panneaux.csv) with two columns with name of streets, avenue, etc. in the city of Annecy (France). I want to find the coordinates of the intersection between those 2 streets but don’t know how to proceed.

* **Third prompt :** I need to geocode two streets and their intersection, whose name is present in the file /Users/arthursarazin/Desktop/Annecy_M12/data_with_coordinates.csv
